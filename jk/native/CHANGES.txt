    * Add CPING/CPONG support to avoid problems with hang tomcats [hgomez]
    * Make POST recovery in LB configurable [hgomez]

Changes with JK 1.2.5
    * Fix a thread safe bug when mapping URI's.
      [billbarker]
    * Fix a thread safe bug when resolving worker host name
      when using mod_jk with Apache 2 and the worker MPM.
      [hgomez]
    * Remove an unnecessary error message when connections to
      all load balanced workers fail.
      [glenn]
    * When mod_jk cannot connect to a worker include the name of
      the worker in the error message.  This is especially helpful
      when you are using load balanced workers.
      [glenn]
    * Fix problem with mod_jk.log getting opened multiple times for
      Apache 2. Only one mod_jk.log can be configured.
      [glenn]
    * Fix Apache 2 connector so that DirectoryIndex works for an
      index.jsp page if JkOptions ForwardDirectories was configured.
      [hgomez]
    * Fix exposure of JSP source if a //path/to.jsp URL was requested
      in Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0 connector.
      [billbarker]

Changes with JK 1.2.4
    * Fix use of libtool for Apache mod_jk builds with more recent
      versions of Apache 2.
      [jfclere]
    * Use reentrant version of strtok() for web server's which use
      threads. This fixes a thread safe bug under Apache 2 and the
      worker MPM.
      [glenn]
    * Fix the Apache 2 mod_jk hook priority so that mod_jk works
      well with both mod_alias and mod_dir.
      [glenn]

Changes with JK 1.2.3:
    * Add the ability to configure JkLog to pipe its log output to an
      executable such as Apache rotatelogs or cronolog.  Apache 2.0 only.
      [glenn]
    * Add JkAutoAlias to Apache 2.0
      [glenn]
    * Apache 2/1.3, if Tomcat returns an error but not content,
      let Apache handle processing the error returned by Tomcat.
    * Added the load balancer sticky_session property. If set to 0
      requests with servlet SESSION ID's can be routed to any Tomcat
      worker. Default is 1, sessions are sticky.
      [glenn]
    * Cleaned up detection and reporting of aborted client connections.
      This cleanup also makes sure that mod_jk does not pass any requests
      on to Tomcat if the remote client aborted its connection.
      [glenn]
    * Fixed a bug in Apache 2.0 which caused a POST request forwarded to
      Tomcat to fail if it generated SSI directives which were post
      processed by mod_include.
      [glenn]
    * Fixed a bug in JkRequestLogFormat when printing the request URI that
      could cause a URI with hex escapes sequences to be formatted wrong.
      [glenn]
      
Changes with JK 1.2.2:
    * tomcat_trend.pl updated script to support changed logging of 
      aborted requests
      [glenn]
    * jk set correctly the content-type in Apache 2.0,
      making it ready to works with mod_deflate and AddOutputFilterByType 
      [hgomez]
    * jk will check result of get_endpoint and handle a failure.
      This call can fail if the allocation for the endpoint fails because of low memory conditions 
      causing a dereference of NULL when we try and access the endpoint
      [mmanders]
      
Changes with JK 1.2.1:
    * Don't send initial chunk for chunked encoding, fix #14282
