<h1>Tomcat Netscape HowTo</h1>

<p>By Gal Shachor &lt;shachor@il.ibm.com&gt;</p>

<p>This document explains how to set up Netscape web servers to cooperate with
Tomcat. Normally the Netscape web servers come with their own Servlet engine,
but you can also configure them to send servlet and JSP requests to Tomcat
using the Tomcat redirector plugin.</p>

<h2>Document Conventions and Assumptions</h2>

<p>&lt;tomcat_home&gt; is the root directory of tomcat. Your Tomcat
installation should have the following subdirectories:

<ol>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\conf - Where you can place various configuration files</li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\webapps - Containing example applications </li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\bin - Where you place web server plugins </li>
</ol>

<p>In all the examples in this document &lt;tomcat_home&gt; will be d:\tomcat.</p>

<p>A <tt>worker</tt> is defined to be a tomcat process that accepts work from
the Netscape server.</p>

<h2>Supported Configuration</h2>

<p>The Netscape-Tomcat redirector was developed and tested on:

<ol>
  <li>WinNT4.0-i386 SP4/SP5/SP6a (it should be able to work on other versions
  of the NT service pack and also UNIX) </li>
  <li>Netscape Enterprise 3.0 and 3.61</li>
  <li>Tomcat3.0 - Tomcat3.1beta1 </li>
</ol>

<p>The redirector uses <b>ajp12</b> to send requests to the Tomcat
containers. There is also an option to use Tomcat in process, more about the
in-process mode can be found in the in process howto.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Netscape redirector is not part of the "official" build of Jakarta, You
can obtain the code and binaries needed for it by accessing
http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.1_beta_1/bin/win32/i386/.
The redirector related file is <tt>nsapi_redirect.dll</tt>.</p>

<p>The Tomcat redirector requires two entities:

<ol>
  <li>nsapi_redirect.dll - The Netscape server plugin, either obtain a
   pre-built DLL or build it yourself (see the build section).</li>
  <li>workers.properties - A file that describes the host(s) and port(s)
   used by the workers (Tomcat processes). This file is located 
   in (<tt>tomcat/conf/workers.properties</tt>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The installation includes the following parts:

<ol>
  <li>Configuring the NSAPI redirector with a default /examples context and 
    checking that you can serve servlets with Netscape.</li>
  <li>Adding more contexts to the configuration.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring the NSAPI Redirector</h3>

<p>In this document I will assume that nsapi_redirect.dll is placed in
d:\tomcat\bin\netscape\nt4\i386\nsapi_redirect.dll and that you created the
properties files are in d:\tomcat\conf.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the Netscape built in servlet support is working disable it.</li>
  <li>Add the redirector plugin into the Netscape server configuration. Edit your server
    obj.conf and add the following lines:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Init section:<br>
      <tt>Init fn=&quot;load-modules&quot; funcs=&quot;jk_init,jk_service&quot;
      shlib=&quot;d:/tomcat/bin/netscape/nt4/i386/nsapi_redirect.dll&quot;<br>
      Init fn=&quot;jk_init&quot; worker_file=&quot;d:/tomcat/conf/workers.properties&quot;
      log_level=&quot;debug&quot; log_file=&quot;d:/tomcat/nsapi.log&quot;</tt> </li>
    <li>In the default object NameTrans section<br>
      <tt>NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/servlet/*&quot;
      name=&quot;servlet&quot;<br>
      NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/examples/*&quot; name=&quot;servlet&quot;</tt></li>
    <li>Create a new configuration object by adding the following lines to the end of the
      obj.conf file:<br>
      <tt>&lt;Object name=servlet&gt; <br>
      ObjectType fn=force-type type=text/plain <br>
      Service fn=&quot;jk_service&quot; worker=&quot;ajp12&quot; <br>
      &lt;/Object&gt;</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Restart Netscape (stop and start the server)</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all, now you should start tomcat and ask Netscape for
http://server:port/examples/</p>

<h3>Adding additional Contexts</h3>

<p>The examples context is useful for verifying your installation, but you will also need
to add your own contexts. Adding a new context requires two operations:

<ol>
  <li>Adding the context to Tomcat (I am not going to talk about this).</li>
  <li>Assigning the NSAPI redirector to handle this context.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assigning the NSAPI redirector to handle this context is simple, all you need to do is
to edit obj.conf and add a NameTrans line that looks like:</p>

<p><tt>NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/&lt;context name&gt;/*&quot;
name=&quot;servlet&quot; </tt></p>

<p>After saving obj.conf restart Netscape and it will serve the new context.</p>

<h2>Building the redirector</h2>

<p>The redirector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, so having this environment is a
prereq if you want to perform a custom build.</p>

<p>The steps that you need to take are: 

<ol>
  <li>Change directory to the nsapi plugins source directory.</li>
  <li>Edit <tt>nsapi.dsp</tt> and update the include and library path to reflect your own
    Netscape server installation (search for a <tt>/I</tt> compiler option and <tt>/libpath</tt>
    linker option)</li>
  <li>Execute the following command:<br>
    <tt>MSDEV nsapi.dsp /MAKE ALL</tt><br>
    If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe</li>
</ol>

<p>This will build both release and debug versions of the redirector plugin. </p>

<p>An alternative will be to open the nsapi workspace file (nsapi.dsw) in msdev and build
it using the build menu.</p>

<h2>How does it work? </h2>

<ol>
  <li>The Netscape-Tomcat redirector is an Netscape service step plugin, Netscape load the
    redirector plugin and calls its service handler function for request that are assigned to
    the &quot;servlet&quot; configuration object. </li>
  <li>For each in-coming request Netscape will execute the set of NameTrans directives that we
    added to obj.conf, the assign-name function will check if it's from parameter matches the
    request URL.</li>
  <li>If a match is found, assign-name will assign the servlet object name to the request.
    This will cause Netscape to send the request to the servlet configuration object.</li>
  <li>Netscape will execute our jk_service extension. The extension collects the request
    parameters and forwards them to the appropriate worker using the ajp12 protocol (the
    worker=&quot;ajp12&quot; parameter in jk_service inform it that the worker for this
    request is named ajp12).</li>
  <li>The extension collects the response from the worker and returns it to the browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced Context Configuration</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is better to have Netscape serve the static pages (html, gif, jpeg etc.)
even if these files are part of a context served by Tomcat. For example, consider the html
and gif files in the examples context, there is no need to serve them from the Tomcat
process, Netscape will suffice.</p>

<p>Making Netscape serve static files that are part of the Tomcat contexts requires the
following:

<ol>
  <li>Configuring Netscape to know about the Tomcat contexts</li>
  <li>Make sure that the WEB-INF directory is protected from access.</li>
  <li>Configuring Netscape to assign the NSAPI redirector only specific requests that requires
    JSP/Servlet handling.</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding a Tomcat context to Netscape requires the addition of a new Netscape 
virtual directory that covers the Tomcat context. For example, adding a 
/example Netscape virtual directory that covers the d:\tomkat\webapps\examples 
directory.

To add a new virtual directory add the following line to your obj.conf:</p>

<p><tt>NameTrans fn=pfx2dir from=/examples dir=&quot;d:/tomcat/webapps/examples&quot;</tt></p>

<p>WEB-INF protection requires some explanation; Each servlet application (context) has a
special directory named WEB-INF, this directory contains sensitive configurations data and
Java classes and must be kept hidden from web users. WEB-INF can be protected by adding
the following line to the PathCheck section in the default configuration object:</p>

<p><tt>PathCheck fn=&quot;deny-existence&quot; path=&quot;*/WEB-INF/*&quot;</tt></p>

<p>This line instructs the Netscape server to reject any request with a URL that contain
the path /WEB-INF/.</p>

<p>Configuring Netscape to assign the NSAPI redirector only specific requests is somewhat
harder, you will need to specify the exact URL-Path pattern(s) that you want Tomcat to
handle (usually only JSP files and servlets). This requires a change to NemaTrans portion
of obj.conf. For the examples context it requires to replace the following line:</p>

<p><tt>NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/examples/*&quot;
name=&quot;servlet&quot;</tt> </p>

<p>with the following two lines:</p>

<p><tt>NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/examples/jsp/*.jsp&quot;
name=&quot;servlet&quot;<br>
NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/examples/servlet/*&quot;
name=&quot;servlet&quot; </tt></p>

<p>As you can see the second configuration is more explicit, it actually instructs
Netscape to assign the redirector with only requests to resources under <tt>/examples/servlet/</tt>
and resources under <tt>/examples/ </tt>whose name ends with <tt>.jsp</tt>. You can be
even more explicit and provide lines such as:</p>

<p><tt>NameTrans fn=&quot;assign-name&quot; from=&quot;/examples/servletname&quot;
name=&quot;servlet&quot;</tt></p>

<p>that instructs Netscape to assign the redirector request whose URL-Path equals <tt>/example/servletname</tt>.</p>

<h2>Advanced Worker Configuration</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to serve different contexts with different Tomcat processes (for
example to spread the load among different machines). To achieve such goal you will need
to define several workers and assign each context with its own worker.</p>

<p>Defining workers is done in workers.properties, this file includes two types of entries:

<ol>
  <li>An entry that lists all the workers defined. For example:<br>
    <tt>worker.list=ajp12, ajp12second</tt></li>
  <li>Entries that define the host and port associated with these workers. For example:<br>
    <tt>worker.ajp12.host=localhost<br>
    worker.ajp12.port=8007<br>
    worker.ajp12second.host=otherhost<br>
    worker.ajp12second.port=8007</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The above examples defined two workers, now we can use these workers to serve two
different contexts each with it&#146;s own worker. Submitting requests to different
workers is accomplished by using multiple Service directives in the servlet configuration
Object, each with a different path pattern parameter. For example, if we want to submit
the /servlet context to a worker named ajp12 and the /examples context to a worker named
ajp12second we should use the following configuration:</p>

<p><tt>&lt;Object name=servlet&gt;<br>
ObjectType fn=force-type type=text/plain<br>
Service fn=&quot;jk_service&quot; worker=&quot;ajp12&quot; path=&quot;/servlet/*&quot;<br>
Service fn=&quot;jk_service&quot; worker=&quot;ajp12second&quot;
path=&quot;/examples/*&quot;<br>
Service fn=&quot;jk_service&quot; worker=&quot;ajp12&quot;<br>
&lt;/Object&gt;</tt></p>
