    <H1>Tomcat-Apache HOWTO</H1>

    <p>This document explains how to connect Tomcat to the popular
      open source web server, Apache.  It was originally part of
      <i>Tomcat: A Minimalistic User's Guide</i> by Gal Shachor, but
      has been split off for organizational reasons.  It should be
      considered a <b>work in progress</b>.  Since the Tomcat source
      tree is constantly changing, the information herein may be out
      of date.  The only definitive reference at this point is the <a

    Integration</a></h3>

    <p> Up until now we have not discussed Tomcat as a server add on,
        instead we have considered it as a <a href="tomcat-ug.html#type_1"> stand-alone</a> container and discussed
        how it can be used.&nbsp; There are however a few problems with this
        picture:
    <ol>
      <li> Tomcat is not as fast as Apache when it comes to static pages. </li>
      <li> Tomcat is not as configurable as Apache. </li>
      <li> Tomcat is not as robust as Apache. </li>
      <li> There are many sites with long time investment in certain web servers,
    for example, sites that are using CGI scripts/Server API modules/perl/php.&nbsp;
        We cannot assume that all of them will want to ditch this legacy. </li>
    </ol>

    <p> For all these reasons it is recommended that real world sites
        use an industrial strength web server, such as Apache, for serving the static content of 
        the site, and use Tomcat as a Servlet/JSP add-on.</p>

    <p> Our agenda:
    <ol>
      <li> Cover the fundamental behavior of the web server. </li>
      <li> Explain what configuration is needed. </li>
      <li> Demonstrate this on Apache. </li>

    <h3> Starting Tomcat From Another Directory </h3>
    
    <h2>Setting Tomcat to Cooperate with the Apache Web Server </h2>

    <h3> Web Server Operation </h3>
    <p> In a nutshell a web server is waiting for client HTTP requests.
        When these requests arrive the server does whatever is needed to 
        serve the requests by providing the necessary content. Adding a 
        servlet container may somewhat change this behavior. Now the web 
        server needs also to perform the following:
    <ul>
      <li> Load the servlet container adapter library and initialize it (prior
           to serving requests). </li>
      <li> When a request arrives, it needs to check and see if a certain 
           request belongs to a servlet, if so it needs to let the adapter
           take the request and handle it.</li>
    </ul>

    The adapter on the other hand needs to know what requests it is
    going to serve, usually based on some pattern in the request URL, and to
    where to direct these requests.

    <p>
      Things are even more complex when the user wants to set a configuration
      that uses virtual hosts, or when they want multiple developers to work
      on the same web server but on different servlet container JVMs. We 
      will cover these two cases in the advanced sections.
    </p>

    <h3> What is the Needed Configuration </h3>
    <p> The most obvious configuration that one can think of is the identity of the servlet URLs
      that are under the responsibility of the servlet container. This is clear; someone must
      know what requests to transmit to the servlet container...
      Yet there are additional configuration items that we should provide to
      the web-server/servlet-container combination:
    <ul>
      <li>We also need to provide configuration regarding the available Tomcat processes
    and on which TCP/IP host/port they are listening. </li>
      <li> We need to tell the web server the location of the adapter library (so it
    will be able to load it on startup). </li>
      <li> We need to set adapter internal information such as where and how much to log, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    All this information must appear either in the web server configuration, or in a private
    configuration files used by the adapter. The next section will demonstrate how configuration
    can be implemented on Apache.


    <h3> Making it on Apache </h3>
    <p> This section shows you how to configure Apache to work with Tomcat;
        it tries to provide explanations as well as insight for the
 	    configuration directives that you should use. You can find
	    additional information in the
	    <a href="http://java.apache.org/jserv/install/index.html">
        jserv install page </a>.
    </p>

    <p> When Tomcat starts up it will automatically generate a configuration
      file for Apache in <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/jserv/tomcat-apache.conf</tt>. Most
      of the time you don't need to do anything but include this file
      (appending "Include TOMCAT_HOME/conf/jserv/tomcat-apache.conf") in your
      httpd.conf.  If you have special needs, for example an AJP port other
      the 8007, you can use this file as a base for  your customized
      configuration and save the results in another file.  If you manage
      the Apache configuration yourself you'll need to update it whenever
      you add a new context.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tomcat:</b> you must restart tomcat and apache after adding
      a new context; Apache doesn't support configuration changes without a
      restart. Also the file <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/jserv/tomcat-apache.conf</tt> is 
	  generated when tomcat starts, so you'll need to start Tomcat before 
	  Apache. Tomcat will overwrite <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf</tt> 
	  each startup so customized configuration should be kept elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p> The Apache-Tomcat configuration uses Apache core configuration directives
      as well as Jserv unique directives so it may confuse you at first, there are
      however two things simplifying it:
    <ul>
      <li> In general you can distinguish between the two directive
           "families" by noting that all the Jserv unique directives start
           with an "ApJServ" prefix. </li>
      <li> The entire Tomcat related configuration is concentrated in a
           single configuration file named tomcat.conf, or the automatically
           generated tomcat-apache.conf, so you can look at a single file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Lets look now at a sample tomcat.conf file.

        </td> 
      </tr> 
    </table>
    <p>As you can see the configuration process was split into 4 steps
       that will now be explained:
      <ol>
      <li> In this step we instruct Apache to load the jserv
           shared-object (or the NT world dll). This is a well known Apache
           directive. If the loading went well and the module came from a 
           file named mod_jserv.c (1a) we can start with the rest of the 
           Jserv-Tomcat configuration. </li>
      <li> This step sets various Jserv internal parameters, these
           parameters:
        <ul>
          <li> Instruct jserv not to start the Tomcat process. Automatically
               starting Tomcat is not implemented yet.</li>
          <li> Disable the secret key challenge/response between Apache and Tomcat.
            Again, the secret key work is not implemented yet.</li>
          <li> Instruct jserv to copy the base server mount points (see next
               section) in case of virtual hosting. </li>
          <li> Instruct jserv to use the notice log level. Other log levels
               include emerg, alert, crit, error, warn, info and debug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> This step sets the default communication parameters.
        Basically it says that the default protocol used for the communication
        is ajpv12 (do not mess with this one) and that the Tomcat process runs on
        the same machine and listens on port 8007. If you run Tomcat on a
        machine other than the one used
        for Apache you should either update your ApJServDefaultHost or use a full
        URL when mounting contexts (see next). Also, if you configured the Tomcat
        connectors to use a port other then 8007, you should update your
        ApJServDefaultPort or use a full URL when mounting contexts.
      </li>
      <li> This step mounts a context to Tomcat. Basically it says that
           all the web server paths that start with /examples go to Tomcat. This
           ApJServMount example is a rather simple one, in fact ApJServMount can
           also provide information regarding the communication protocol to be used
           and the location where the Tomcat process listens, for example:
           <div><tt>ApJServMount /examples ajpv12://hostname:port/root</tt></div>
           mounts the context /examples to a Tomcat process that runs on host
           "hostname" and listens on port number "port".
      </li>
    </ol>
    Now that you understand the different configuration instructions in the sample
    file, how can you add it to the Apache configuration? One "simple" method is to
    write it's content in the httpd.conf (the Apache configuration file), this however
    can be very messy. Instead you should use the Apache include directive. At the end
    of the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) add the following directive:
    <div> <tt>include &lt;full path to the Tomcat configuration file&gt; </tt></div>
    for example:
    <div> <tt>include /tome/tomcat/conf/tomcat.conf </tt></div> This
    will add your Tomcat configuration to Apache, after that you should copy
    the jserv module to the Apache libexec (or modules in the Win32 case)
    directory and restart (stop+start) Apache. It should now be able to
    connect to Tomcat.

    <h3> Obtaining the Jserv Module (mod_jserv) </h3>
    <p> As previously stated, we need a web server adapter to sit in Apache and redirect
      requests to Tomcat. For Apache, this adapter is a slightly modified version of
      mod_jserv.
    </p>
    <p> You may try to look <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html">
      here </a> and see if there is an already pre-built version of mod_jserv that
      suites your OS (Usually there is one for NT), however, being a native library you
      should not expect that yet (too many OS's, not enough developers, life
      too short...).
      Moreover, small variations in the way you built Apache/Your specific UNIX variant may
      result in dynamic linking errors. You should really try to build mod_jserv for your
      system (don't panic, it is not that hard!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Building mod_jserv on <b>UNIX</b> involves the following:
    <ol>
      <li> Download the source distribution of Tomcat from
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html"> here</a>. </li>
      <li> Uncompress it into some directory. </li>
      <li> Building the module:
    <ul>
      <li> Change directory into jakarta-tomcat/src/native/apache/jserv/</li>
      <li> Execute the build command <div><tt> apxs -c -o mod_jserv.so *.c  </tt></div> 
        apxs is part of the Apache distribution and should be located in your
        APACHE_HOME/bin.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>  
    Building mod_jserv for <b>Win32</b> is less likely (you already have a downloadable dll
    for Win32). Yet if you <em>want</em> to build it you should install Visual C++ and 
    perform the following:
    <ol>
      <li> Download the source distribution of Tomcat from
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html"> here</a>. </li>
      <li> Unzip it into some directory. </li>
      <li> Building the module:
    <ul>
      <li> Change directory into jakarta-tomcat\src\native\apache\jserv</li>
      <li> Add  Visual C++ into your environment by executing the script
        VCVARS32.BAT. </li>
      <li> Execute the build command <div><tt> nmake -f Makefile.win32 </tt></div>
        nmake is the Visual C++ make program.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    That's it; you have built mod_jserv...
    <h3> Making Apache Serve your Context's Static Files </h3>
    <p> The previous Apache-Tomcat configuration file was somewhat
	    inefficient, it instructed Apache to send any request for a resource
        that starts with the <tt>/examples</tt> prefix to be served by
        Tomcat. Do we really want that? There are many static files that may
        be a part of our servlet context (for example images and static
        HTML), why should Tomcat serve these files?
    </p>
    <p>You may actually have reasons for doing that, for example:
        <ol>
            <li>You may want to configure Tomcat based security for these
                resources. </li>
            <li>You may want to follow users requests for static resources
                using interceptors. </li>
        </ol>
       In general however, this is not that case; and making Tomcat save
       static files is just a CPU waste. We should instead have Apache serve
       these static files and not Tomcat. Lets look now at a sample
       tomcat.conf file that does exactly that:
    <p> Having Apache serve the static files requires the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Instructing Apache to send all servlet requests to Tomcat. </li>
            <li>Instructing Apache to send all JSP requests to Tomcat. </li>
        </ol>
        and leaving Apache to handle the rest. Lets look now at a sample 
        tomcat.conf file that does exactly that:
    <table border="1" 
           cellspacing="0"

        </td> 
      </tr> 
    </table>
    
    <p>
      As you can see, the beginning of this configuration file is the same
      as seen in the previous example. The last step (mounting a context),
      however,  was replaced in a long series of Apache and ApJServ
      configuration directives that will now be explained:
      <ol>
        <li> This step informs Apache of the context location and aliases it
             to an Apache virtual directory. This way Apache can serve files
             from this directory.</li>
        <li> This optional step instructs Apache more about how to serve the
             context; for example you can decide if Apache will allow
             directory indexing (listing) or set a special index file.</li>
        <li> This step instructs Apache to protect the WEB-INF directory
             from client access. For security reasons it is important to
             prevent visitors from viewing the content of the WEB-INF
             directory, for example web.xml can provide valuable information
             for intruders. This step blocks the WEB-INF content from
             visitors. </li>
        <li> This step instructs Apache to serve all the jsp locations
             within the context using the jserv servlet handler. The servlet
             handler redirects these requests based on the default host and
             port.</li>
        <li> This step mounts specific servlet URLs to Tomcat. You should
             note that you should have as many such mount directives as the
             number of specific servlet URLs. </li>
        <li> This last step is an example for the addition of servlet only 
             context to Tomcat. </li>                                       
      </ol>
      
      It is easy to see that this configuration is much more complex and
      error prone then the first example, this however is the price that you 
      should (for now) pay for improved performance.

    <h3> Configuring for Multiple Tomcat JVMs </h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is useful to have different contexts handled by 
        different JVMs, for example: 
        <ul>
            <li> When each context serves a different, specific task and runs
                 on a different machine. </li>
            <li> When we want to have multiple developers work on a private
                 Tomcat process but use the same web server. </li>
        </ul>
        Implementing such schemes where different contexts are served by
        different JVMs is very easy and the following configuration file
        demonstrates this:

            </pre> 
        </td> 
      </tr> 
    </table>
    <p>
    As you can see in the previous example, using several JVMs (even even 
	those that run on different machines) can be accomplished easily by 
	using a full ajp URL mount. In this full URL we actually specify the 
	host where the Tomcat process is located and it's port.
    </p>
    <p>
    Had the two Tomcat processes run on the same machine, we would have to
    configure each of them with different connector ports. For example,
    assuming that the two JVMs runs on localhost, the Apache-Tomcat
    configuration should have something that looks like:

    Looking at the above file you can see that we have two explicit ApJServ
    mount points each pointing to a different port on the same machine. It
    is clear that this configuration requires support from the configuration
    found in the server.xml files. We will need in these files different
    &lt;Connector&gt; configurations, for the different Tomcat processes. We
    will actually need two different server.xml files (lets call them
    server_joe.xml and server_bill.xml) with different &lt;Connector&gt;
    entries as shown in the next two samples:

        The port configuration is not the only place where the joe and bill
        configuration differs. We have @@@ marks in the xml files marking
        the four places where changes had to be made. As you can see, this
        difference is necessary to avoid the two Tomcat processes from
		overwriting each other's logs and workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we should start the two tomcat processes using the -f command
        line option:
        <div> bin\starup -f conf\server_joe.xml</div>
        <div> bin\starup -f conf\server_bill.xml</div>
        and then access them from Apache based on the different URL path
        prefixes.

    <h3> Configuring Virtual Hosting </h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to support virtual hosts under Tomcat Ver3.1, in fact
        the virtual host configuration is very similar to configuring for
        multiple JVM (as explained in the previous section) and the reason
        is simple; in Tomcat 3.1 each virtual host is implemented by a 
		different Tomcat process.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the current (Ver3.1) Tomcat, virtual hosting awareness is
        provided by the web server (Apache/Netscape…). The web server
        virtual hosting support is used by the Tomcat adapter to
        redirect requests belonging to a certain virtual host to the JVM(s)
        containing the contexts of this virtual host. This means that if (for
        example) we have two virtual hosts (vhost1 and vhost2), we will have
        two JVMs: one running the contexts of vhost1 and the other running
        the contexts of vhost2. These JVMs are not aware of each others 
		existence, in fact, they are not aware of the concept of virtual 
		hosting. All the virtual hosting logic is inside the web-server 
		adapter. To make things clearer, lets look at the following sample 
		Apache-Tomcat configuration file:
    </p>

    <p>
        As can be seen, steps 1,2 and 3 define two Apache virtual hosts and 
        for each of them, mount the /examples context to a certain ajpv12 URL. 
        Each such ajpv12 URL points to a JVM that contains the virtual host. 
        The configuration of the two JVMs is very similar to the one
        demonstrated in the previous section, we will need again to use two 
        different server.xml files (one for each virtual host process) and
        we will need to start the Tomcat processes with the -f command line 
        option. After doing that we will be able to approach Apache, each
        time with a different host name, and the adapter will redirect us to 
        the appropriate JVM.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The need for improved virtual host support</u></strong><br>
        Having each virtual host implemented by a different JVM is a huge 
        scalability problem. The next versions of Tomcat will make it 
        possible to support several virtual hosts within the same Tomcat 
        JVM.
