<h3>Changes in Jk2</h2>

</h4>User visible</h4>

<ul>
<li>Logging. Jk2 will use the 'native' logging mechanism, wherever is available.
For example in apache the logs will go to apache's error.log. If a 'native'
implementation is not available jk will use the old mod_jk.log.

<li>Apache(2) configuration 
  <ul>
    <li><b>"JkSet name value"</b> can be used to specify the same options as in
workers.properties. The admin can choose to use only apache's httpd.conf, without
any external file.</li>
    <li>(not completed) <b>"JkWorker worker"</b> directive can be used in a Location 
context to specify a webapp. This is particularly usefull for sites with many
virtual hosts / webapps where the Location-based and native vhost  mapping is more 
efficient.</li>
    <li> 
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Developer specific</h4>

<ul>
<li>Created an 'object' registry. All jk components will follow a common pattern
for creation, and developers will be able to 'plug' their own 
implementation and override the defaults. 

<li>Memory manangement. Use pools more extensively, almost all mallocs have been
replaced. 

<li>Native pools. The pool is based on virtual functions and may use the native
server mechanism. For Apache2 ( and as a default for servers not having a pool )
we can use APR ( or the original jk_pool if APR is not available for a server ).

<li>Native maps and apr based impl. jk2 maps now use virtual methods that allow
server-specific implementation. That avoids copying the headers and attributes
( and lazy access ). The apr based impl will be the default to be used for servers
not providing a native map. ( we still use jk_map for object storage, as apr_table
can be used only for string values )

<li>Native loggers. Jk2 logger uses virtual methods and may use the 'native' 
server-specific logging mechanism. The original file logger can be used
for servers not providing a logger ( or until a specific logger is implemented ).

<li>Reorganised and simplified data structures. Now most usefull information about
workers is exposed in the core interfaces.

<li>Pool reuse. In normal operation jk2 will operate in constant memory, the 
endpoint pool will be reset and will not require a malloc per request. ( same is 
true for apache2 request processing )

<li>Method signatures. Jk2 uses the same 'patterns' as jni, with a jk_env as 
first parameter, then 'this' (the pointer to the object ), then regular parameters.
The same pattern is used no consistently in all methods.

<li>(not completed) Error handling. The env parameter will provide a mechanism to
pass error information up the stack ( eventually a stack trace ). It'll also   
provide per/thread storage and a temp pool.

</ul>
