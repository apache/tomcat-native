<section name="Introduction">
<br/>
<p>
A <b>Tomcat worker</b> is a Tomcat instance that is waiting to execute servlets or any other content
on behalf of some web server. For example, we can have a web server such as
Apache forwarding servlet requests to a Tomcat process (the worker) running behind it.
</p>
<p>
The scenario described above is a very simple one;
in fact one can configure multiple Tomcat workers to serve servlets on
behalf of a certain web server.
The reasons for such configuration can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We want different contexts to be served by different Tomcat workers to provide a
development environment where all the developers share the same web server but
own a Tomcat worker of their own.
</li>
<li>
We want different virtual hosts served by different Tomcat processes to provide a
clear separation between sites belonging to different companies.
</li>
<li>
We want to provide load balancing, meaning run multiple Tomcat workers each on a
machine of its own and distribute the requests between them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are probably more reasons for having multiple workers but I guess that this list is enough...
Tomcat workers are defined in a properties file dubbed <b>workers.properties</b> and this tutorial
explains how to work with it.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Directives">
<br/>
<p>Each workers.properties directive consists of three words separated by dot. The first word is always
<b>worker</b>. The second word is the worker name that can be any name. The worker name reflects the
name of the <b>jvmRoute</b> defined in Tomcat's server.xml configuration file.
</p>
<p>
<warn>
The name of the worker can contain only the alphanumeric characters <b>[a-z][A-Z][0-9][_\-]</b> and is case sensitive.
</warn>
</p>

<subsection name="Defining workers">
<br/>
<p>The generic workers.properties directive is in the form:</p>
<p><strong>worker.&lt;worker name&gt;.&lt;directive&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Defining workers to the Tomcat web server plugin can be done using a properties file
(a sample file named workers.properties is available in the conf/ directory).
</p>
<directives>
<directive name="worker.list" default="ajp13" required="true">
A comma separated list of workers names that the JK will use. When starting up,
the web server plugin will instantiate the workers whose name appears in the
worker.list property, these are also the workers to whom you can map requests.
<p>
This directive can be used multiple times.
</p>
</directive>
<directive name="worker.maintain" default="60" required="false">
Worker connection pool maintain interval in seconds. If set to the positive
value JK will scan all connections for all workers specified in worker.list
directive and check if connections needs to be recycled.
<p>
Furthermore any load balancer does a global maintenance every worker.maintain
seconds. During global maintenance load counters are decayed and workers
in error are checked for recover_time.
</p>
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.13</b>.
</p>
</directive>
</directives>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Mandatory directives">
<br/>
<p>Mandatory directives are the one that each worker <b>must</b> contain. Without them the worker will
be unavailable or will misbehave.
</p>
<directives>
<directive name="type" default="ajp13" required="true">
Type of the worker (can be one of ajp13, ajp14, jni, lb or status). The type of the worker
defines the directives that can be applied to the worker.
<p>AJP13 worker is the preferred worker type that JK uses for communication
between web server and Tomcat. This type of worker uses sockets as communication
channel. For detailed description of the AJP13 protocol stack browse to
<a href="../ajp/ajpv13a.html">AJPv13 protocol specification</a>
</p>
</directive>
</directives>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Connection directives">
<p>Connection directives defines the parameters needed to connect and maintain
the connections pool of persistent connections between JK and remote Tomcat.
</p>
<directives>

<directive name="host" default="localhost" required="false">
Host name or IP address of the backend Tomcat instance. The remote Tomcat must
support the ajp13 protocol stack. The host name can have a <b>port</b> number
embedded separated by the colon (':') character.
</directive>

<directive name="port" default="8009" required="false">
Port number of the remote Tomcat instance listening for defined protocol requests.
The default value depends on the worker type. For AJP13 workers the default port is
<b>8009</b>, while for AJP14 type of worker that value is <b>8011</b>.
</directive>

<directive name="socket_timeout" default="0" required="false">
Socket timeout in seconds used for communication channel between JK and remote host.
If remote host does not respond inside that timeout the JK will generate an error,
and retry again. If set to value zero (default) the JK will wait for infinite
on all socket operations.
</directive>

<directive name="socket_keepalive" default="False" required="false">
This directive should be used when you have a firewall between your webserver
and the Tomcat engine, who tend to drop inactive connections. This flag will told Operating System
to send <code>KEEP_ALIVE</code> message on inactive connections (interval depend on global OS settings,
generally 120 minutes), and thus prevent the firewall to cut the connection.
To enable keepalive set this property value to the <b>True</b>.
<p>
The problem with Firewall cutting inactive connections is that sometimes, neither webserver or tomcat
have information about the cut and couldn't handle it.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="retries" default="3" required="false">
The number of retries that the worker will try in case of error returned from remote
Tomcat. If the number of retries set is greater then three (the default value), on
each retry after default an extra wait of 100ms will be inserted.
</directive>

<directive name="connection_pool_size" default="see text" required="false">
This defines the number of connections made to the AJP backend that
are maintained as a connection pool.
It will limit the number of those connection that each web server child
process can made.
<p>
Connection pool size property is used only for multi threaded
web servers such as Apache 2.0 (worker), IIS and Netscape. The connection_pool_size property
should reflect the number of threads per child process. JK will discover
the number of threads per child process on Apache 2 web server with worker-mpm and set
its default value to match the ThreadsPerChild Apache directive. For IIS the default
value is 10. For other web servers than Apache or IIS this value has to be set manually.
</p>
<warn>Do not use connection_pool_size with values higher then 1 on <b>Apache 2.x prefork</b> or <b>Apache 1.3.x</b>!</warn>
</directive>

<directive name="connection_pool_minsize" default="pool/2" required="false">
Minimum size of the connection pool that will be maintained.
<p>
This property is used only when the <b>connection_pool_size</b> is specified.
Its default value is connection_pool_size/2.
</p>
<warn>Do not use connection_pool_size with values higher then 1 on <b>Apache 2.x prefork</b> or <b>Apache 1.3.x</b>!</warn>
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.16</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="connection_pool_timeout" default="0" required="false">
Cache timeout property should be used with <b>connection_pool_size</b> to specify how long JK should keep
an inactive socket in cache before closing it. This property should be used to reduce the number of threads
on the Tomcat web server. The default value zero disables the closing (infinite timeout).
<p>
Each child could open an ajp13 connection if it have to forward a request to Tomcat, creating
a new ajp13 thread on Tomcat side.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that after an ajp13 connection is created, the child won't drop it
until killed. And since the webserver will keep its childs/threads running
to handle high-load, even it the child/thread handle only static contents, you could
finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="lbfactor" default="1" required="false">
Only used for a member worker of a load balancer.
<p>
The integer number lbfactor (load-balancing factor) is
<i>how much we expect this worker to work</i>, or
<i>the worker's work quota</i>. Load balancing factor is compared with other workers
that makes the load balancer. For example if one worker has lb_factor 5 times higher then
other worker, then it will receive five times more requests.
</p>
</directive>

</directives>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Load balancing directives">
<br/>
<p>Load balancer is a virtual worker that does not really communicate with Tomcat workers.
Instead it is responsible for the management of several "real" workers.
The worker is supposed to be a load balancer if it's worker type is <b>lb</b>.
See worker's <b>type</b> directive. The workers that
are member of load balancer must not appear in the <b>worker.list</b> directive.
</p>
<p>Loadbalancer directives defines the parameters needed to create a workers that are
connecting to a remote cluster of backend Tomcat servers. Each cluster node has to
have a worker defined.
</p>
<p>
Load balancer management includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Instantiating the workers in the web server.
</li>
<li>
Using the worker's load-balancing factor, perform weighed-round-robin load balancing where
high lbfactor means stronger machine (that is going to handle more requests)
</li>
<li>
Keeping requests belonging to the same session executing on the same Tomcat worker.
</li>
<li>
Identifying failed Tomcat workers, suspending requests to them and instead fall-backing on
other workers managed by the lb worker.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overall result is that workers managed by the same lb worker are load-balanced
(based on their lbfactor and current user session) and also fall-backed so a single
Tomcat process death will not "kill" the entire site.
The following table specifies properties that the lb worker can accept:
</p>

<directives>
<directive name="balance_workers" default="" required="true">
A comma separated list of workers that the load balancer
need to manage.
<p>
This directive can be used multiple times for the same load balancer.
</p>
<p>
This directive replaces old <b>balanced_workers</b> directive and
can be used only with mod_jk versions 1.2.7 and up.
</p>
<warn>These workers should <b>not</b> appear in the worker.list property!</warn>
</directive>

<directive name="sticky_session" default="True" required="false">
Specifies whether requests with SESSION ID's should be routed back to the same
Tomcat worker. If sticky_session is set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b> sessions are sticky, otherwise
sticky_session is set to <b>False</b>. Set sticky_session to <b>False</b> when Tomcat
is using a Session Manager which can persist session data across multiple
instances of Tomcat. By default sticky_session is set to True.
</directive>

<directive name="sticky_session_force" default="False" required="false">
Specifies whether requests with SESSION ID's for workers that are in error state
should be rejected. If sticky_session_force is set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b>
and the worker that matches that SESSION ID is in error state, client will
recieve 500 (Server Error). If set to <b>False</b> or <b>0</b> failover on
another worker will be issued with loosing client session. This directive is
used only when you set <b>sticky_session=True</b>.
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.9</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="method" default="Request" required="false">
Specifies what method load balancer is using for electing the best worker.
Please note, that session stickyness and perfect load balancing are
conflicting targets, especially when the number
of sessions is small, or the usage of sessions is extremely varying
For huge numbers of sessions this usually is not a problem.
<p>
Some methods note, that they aggregate in a sliding time window. They add up
accesses, and on each run of the global maintain method, the load counters
get divided by 2. Usually this happens once a minute, depending on the
setting of worker.maintain. The value of the load counters can be inspected
using the status worker.
</p>
<p>
If method is set to <b>R[equest]</b> the balancer will use number of requests
to find the best worker. Accesses will be distributed according to the
lbfactor in a sliding time window. This is the default value and should be
working well for most applications.
</p>
<p>
If method is set to <b>S[ession]</b> the balancer will use number of sessions
to find the best worker. Accesses will be distributed according to the
lbfactor in a sliding time window. Because the balancer does not keep any state,
it actually does not know the number of sessions. Instead it counts each request
without a session cookie or URL encoding as a new session. This method will neither
know, when a session is being invalidated, nor will it correct its load numbers
according to session timeouts or worker failover. This method should be used,
if sessions are your limiting resource, e.g. when you only have limited memory
and your sessions need a lot of memory.
</p>
<p>
If set to <b>T[raffic]</b> the balancer will use
the network traffic between JK and Tomcat to find the best worker.
Accesses will be distributed according to the lbfactor in a sliding time window.
This method should be used, if network to and from the backends is your
limiting resource.
</p>
<p>
If set to <b>B[usyness]</b> the balancer will
pick the worker with the lowest current load, based on how many requests the
worker is currently serving. This number is divided by the workers lbfactor,
and the lowest value (least busy) worker is picked. This method is especially
interesting, if your request take a long time to process, like for a download
application.
</p>
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.9</b>.
The Session method has been added in <b>jk 1.2.20</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="lock" default="Optimistic" required="false">
Specifies what lock method the load balancer will use for synchronizing
shared memory runtime data.
If lock is set to <b>O[ptimistic]</b> balancer will not use shared memory lock
to find the best worker. If set to <b>P[essimistic]</b> balancer will use
shared memory lock. The balancer will work more accurately in case of
Pessimistic locking, but can slow down the average response time.

<directive name="good" default="a.o,a.n,a.b,a.r" required="false">
For every load balancer worker, the status worker shows a summary
of the state of its members. There are three such states,
"good", "bad" and "degraded".
<p>
These states are determined depending on the activation of the members
(active, disabled, stopped) and their runtime state
(ok, n/a, busy, recovering, error).
By default, members are assumed to be "good", if their activation
is "active" and their runtime state is not "error".
</p>
<p>
You can change this mapping, by assigning a list of values to the
attribute "good". Each value gives a possible match for the members,
and one match suffices. Each value is either a single character, or two
characters combined with a dot ".". The single characters are the
first characters in the words "active", "disabled", "stopped",
"ok", "na", "busy", "recovering", "error". If a value consists only
of a single character, then all members with this activation or runtime
state will be assumed good. A combination of an activation and a runtime
state concatenated with a dot "." does only apply to a member, that has
exactly this activation and state.
</p>
<p>
Members of a load balancer will first be matched against the state "bad",
if they don't match, the state "good" will be tried, and if they
still don't match, their state will be "degraded".

Set this value to the HTTP status code that will cause a worker to fail
if returned from Servlet contatiner. Use this directive to deal with
cases when the servlet container can temporary return non-200 responses
for a short amount of time, e.g during redeployment.

<subsection name="Deprecated worker directives">
<br/>
<p>The following directives have been deprecated in the past. We include their documentation
in case you need to use an older version of mod_jk. We urge you to update and not use
them any more. Please migrate your existing configurations.
</p>
<deprecations>
<directive name="cachesize" successor="connection_pool_size" default="see text" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.16.</warn>
Cachesize defines the number of connections made to the AJP backend that
are maintained as a connection pool.
It will limit the number of those connection that each web server child
process can make.
<p>
Cachesize property is used only for multi threaded 
web servers such as Apache 2.0 (worker), IIS and Netscape. The cachesize property
should reflect the number of threads per child process. JK will discover
the number of threads per child process on Apache 2 web server with worker-mpm and set
its default value to match the ThreadsPerChild Apache directive. For IIS the default
value is 10. For other web servers than Apache or IIS this value has to be set manually.
</p>
<warn>Do not use cachesize with values higher then 1 on <b>Apache 2.x prefork</b> or <b>Apache 1.3.x</b>!</warn>
</directive>

<directive name="cache_timeout" successor="connection_pool_timeout" default="0" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.16.</warn>
Cache timeout property should be used with <b>cachesize</b> to specify how to time JK should keep
an open socket in cache before closing it. This property should be used to reduce the number of threads 
on the Tomcat web server.
<p> 
Each child could open an ajp13 connection if it have to forward a request to Tomcat, creating
a new ajp13 thread on Tomcat side.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that after an ajp13 connection is created, the child won't drop it
until killed. And since the webserver will keep its childs/threads running
to handle high-load, even it the child/thread handle only static contents, you could
finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="recycle_timeout" successor="connection_pool_timeout" default="0" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.16.</warn>
The number of seconds that told webserver to cut an ajp13 connection after some time of 
inactivity. When choosing an endpoint for a request and the assigned socket is open, it will be
closed if it was not used for the configured time.
It's a good way to ensure that there won't too old threads living on Tomcat side, 
with the extra cost you need to reopen the socket next time a request be forwarded.
This property is very similar to <b>cache_timeout</b> but works also in non-cache mode.
If set to value zero (default) no recycle will took place. 
</directive>

<directive name="balanced_workers" successor="balance_workers" default="" required="true">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.7.</warn>
A comma separated list of workers that the load balancer
need to manage.
</directive>

<directive name="disabled" successor="activation" default="False" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.19.</warn>
If set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b> the worker will be disabled if member
of load balancer. This flag can be changed at runtime using status worker.
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.9</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="stopped" successor="activation" default="False" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.19.</warn>
If set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b> the worker will be stopped if member
of load balancer. The flag is needed for stop complete traffic of a sticky session
worker. It is only usefull, when you have a cluster that replicated the sessions.
This flag can be changed at runtime using status worker.
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.11</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="jvm_route" successor="route" default="worker name" required="false">
<warn>This directive has been deprecated since 1.2.20.</warn>
Normally the name of a balanced worker in a load balancer is equal to the jvmRoute
of the corresponding Tomcat instance. If you want to include a worker corresponding
to a Tomcat instance into several load balancers with different balancing configuration
(e.g. disabled, stopped) you can use this attribute.
<p>
Define a seperate worker per lb and per Tomcat instance with an arbitrary worker name and 
set the jvm_route attribute of the worker equal to the jvmRoute of the target Tomcat instance.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is left empty, the name of the worker will be used.
</p>
<p>
This attribute can be changed at runtime using status worker.
</p>
