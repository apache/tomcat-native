<section name="Introduction">
<p>
A <b>Tomcat worker</b> is a Tomcat instance that is waiting to execute servlets or any other content
on behalf of some web server. For example, we can have a web server such as
Apache forwarding servlet requests to a Tomcat process (the worker) running behind it.
</p>
<p>
The scenario described above is a very simple one; 
in fact one can configure multiple Tomcat workers to serve servlets on 
behalf of a certain web server. 
The reasons for such configuration can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We want different contexts to be served by different Tomcat workers to provide a 
development environment where all the developers share the same web server but
own a Tomcat worker of their own.
</li>
<li>
We want different virtual hosts served by different Tomcat processes to provide a 
clear separation between sites belonging to different companies.
</li>
<li>
We want to provide load balancing, meaning run multiple Tomcat workers each on a 
machine of its own and distribute the requests between them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are probably more reasons for having multiple workers but I guess that this list is enough...
Tomcat workers are defined in a properties file dubbed <b>workers.properties</b> and this tutorial 
explains how to work with it.
</p>
</section>
 
<section name="Directives">
<p>Each workers.properties directive consists of three words separated by dot. The first word is always
<b>worker</b>. The second word is the worker name that can be any name. The worker name reflects the
name of the <b>jvmRoute</b> defined in Tomcat's server.xml configuration file.
</p>
<p>
<warn>
The name of the worker can contain only the alphanumeric characters <b>[a-z][A-Z][0-9]</b> and is case insensitive.
</warn>
</p>

<subsection name="Defining workers">
<p>The generic workers.properties directive is in the form:</p>
<p><strong>worker.&lt;worker name&gt;.&lt;directive&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Defining workers to the Tomcat web server plugin can be done using a properties file
(a sample file named workers.properties is available in the conf/ directory).
</p>
<directives>
<directive name="worker.list" default="ajp13" required="true">
A comma separated list of workers names that the JK will use. When starting up,
the web server plugin will instantiate the workers whose name appears in the
worker.list property, these are also the workers to whom you can map requests. 
</directive>
</directives>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Mandatory directives">
<p>Mandatory directives are the one that each worker <b>must</b> contain. Without them the worker will
be unavailable or will misbehave.
</p>
<directives>
<directive name="type" default="ajp13" required="true">
Type of the worker (can be one of ajp13, ajp14, jni or lb). The type of the worker
defines the directives that can be applied to the worker.
<p>AJP13 worker is the preferred worker type that JK uses for communication
between web server and Tomcat. This type of worker uses sockets as communication
channel. For detailed description of the AJP13 protocol stack browse to
<a href="../common/ajpv13a.html">AJPv13 protocol specification</a>
</p>
</directive>
</directives>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Connection directives">
<p>Connection directives defines the parameters needed to connect and maintain
the connections pool of persistent connections between JK and remote Tomcat.
</p>
<directives>

<directive name="host" default="localhost" required="false">
Host name or IP address of the backend Tomcat instance. The remote Tomcat must
support the ajp13 protocol stack. The host name can have a <b>port</b> number
embedded separated by the colon (':') character.
</directive>

<directive name="port" default="8009" required="false">
Port number of the remote Tomcat instance listening for defined protocol requests.
The default value depends on the worker type. For AJP13 workers the default port is
<b>8009</b>, while for AJP14 type of worker that value is <b>8011</b>.
</directive>

<directive name="socket_timeout" default="0" required="false">
Socket timeout in seconds used for communication channel between JK and remote host.
If remote host does not respond inside that timeout the JK will generate an error,
and retry again. If set to value zero (default) the JK will wait for infinite
on all socket operations.
</directive>

<directive name="socket_keepalive" default="False" required="false">
This directive should be used when you have a firewall between your webserver
and the Tomcat engine, who tend to drop inactive connections. This flag will told Operating System
to send <code>KEEP_ALIVE</code> message on inactive connections (interval depend on global OS settings,
generally 120ms), and thus prevent the firewall to cut the connection.
To enable keepalive set this property value to the number greater then <b>0</b>.
<p>
The problem with Firewall cutting inactive connections is that sometimes, neither webserver or tomcat
have information about the cut and couldn't handle it.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="recycle_timeout" default="0" required="false">
The number of seconds that told webserver to cut an ajp13 connection after some time of 
inactivity. When choosing an endpoint for a request and the assigned socket is open, it will be
closed if it was not used for the configured time.
It's a good way to ensure that there won't too old threads living on Tomcat side, 
with the extra cost you need to reopen the socket next time a request be forwarded.
This property is very similar to <b>cache_timeout</b> but works also in non-cache mode.
If set to value zero (default) no recycle will took place. 
</directive>

<directive name="retries" default="3" required="false">
The number of retries that the worker will try in case of error returned from remote
Tomcat. If the number of retries set is greater then three (the default value), on
each retry after default an extra wait of 100ms will be inserted.
</directive>

<directive name="cachesize" default="1" required="false">
Cachesize defines the number of connections made to the AJP backend that
are maintained as a connection pool.
It does not limit the number of those connection. 
<p>
Cachesize property is useful when you're using JK in multi threaded 
web servers such as Apache 2.0 (worker), IIS and Netscape. The cachesize property
should reflect the number of threads per child process. The JK 1.2.8 will discover
the number of threads per child process on Apache 2 web server with worker-mpm.
For other web servers to will have to set that value manually.
</p>
<warn>Do not use cachesize with values higher then 1 on <b>prefork mpm</b> or <b>apache 1.3.x</b>!</warn>
</directive>

<directive name="cache_timeout" default="0" required="false">
Cache timeout property should be used with <b>cachesize</b> to specify how to time JK should keep
an open socket in cache before closing it. This property should be used to reduce the number of threads 
on the Tomcat WebServer.
<p> 
Each child could open an ajp13 connection if it have to forward a request to Tomcat, creating
a new ajp13 thread on Tomcat side.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that after an ajp13 connection is created, the child won't drop it
until killed. And since the webserver will keep its childs/threads running
to handle high-load, even it the child/thread handle only static contents, you could
finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.
</p>. 
</directive>

<directive name="lbfactor" default="1" required="false">
Integer number used when the worker will be used inside load balancer worker,
this is the load-balancing factor for the worker.
The load-balancing factor is <i>how much we expect this worker to work</i>, or
<i>the worker's work quota</i>. Load balancing factor is compared with other workers
that makes the load balancer. For example if one worker has lb_factor 5 times higher then
other worker, then it will receive five times more requests. 
</directive>

</directives>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Load balancing directives">
<br/>
<p>Load balancer is a virtual worker that does not really communicate with Tomcat workers.
Instead it is responsible for the management of several "real" workers.
The worker is supposed to be a load balancer if it's worker type is <b>lb</b>.
See worker's <b>type</b> directive. The workers that
are member of load balancer must not appear in the <b>worker.list</b> directive.
</p>
<p>Loadbalancer directives defines the parameters needed to create a workers that are
connecting to a remote cluster of backend Tomcat servers. Each cluster node has to
have a worker defined.
</p>
<p>
Load balancer management includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Instantiating the workers in the web server.
</li>
<li>
Using the worker's load-balancing factor, perform weighed-round-robin load balancing where 
high lbfactor means stronger machine (that is going to handle more requests)
</li>
<li>
Keeping requests belonging to the same session executing on the same Tomcat worker.
</li>
<li>
Identifying failed Tomcat workers, suspending requests to them and instead fall-backing on 
other workers managed by the lb worker.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overall result is that workers managed by the same lb worker are load-balanced
(based on their lbfactor and current user session) and also fall-backed so a single
Tomcat process death will not "kill" the entire site.
The following table specifies properties that the lb worker can accept:
</p>

<directives>
<directive name="balance_workers" default="" required="true">
A comma separated list of workers that the load balancer
need to manage.
<p>
This directive replaces old <b>balanced_workers</b> directive and
can be used only with mod_jk versions 1.2.7 and up.
</p>
<warn>These workers should <b>not</b> appear in the worker.list property!</warn>
</directive>

<directive name="sticky_session" default="True" required="false">
Specifies whether requests with SESSION ID's should be routed back to the same
Tomcat worker. If sticky_session is set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b> sessions are sticky, otherwise
sticky_session is set to <b>False</b>. Set sticky_session to <b>False</b> when Tomcat
is using a Session Manager which can persist session data across multiple
instances of Tomcat. By default sticky_session is set to True.
</directive>

<directive name="sticky_session_force" default="False" required="false">
Specifies whether requests with SESSION ID's for workers that are in error state
should be rejected. If sticky_session_force is set to <b>True</b> or <b>1</b>
and the worker that matches that SESSION ID is in error state, client will
recieve 500 (Server Error). If set to <b>False</b> or <b>0</b> failover on
another worker will be issued with loosing client session. This directive is
used only when you set <b>sticky_session=True</b>.
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.9</b>.
</p>
</directive>

<directive name="method" default="Request" required="false">
Specifies what method load balancer is using for electing best worker.
If method is set to <b>R[equest]</b> balancer will use number of requests
to find the best worker. If set to <b>T[raffic]</b> balancer will use
the network traffic between JK and Tomcat to find the best worker.
<p>
This feature has been added in <b>jk 1.2.9</b>.

Connect timeout property told webserver to send a PING request on ajp13 connection after 
connection is established. The parameter is the delay in milliseconds to wait for the PONG reply.
<p>
This features has been added in <b>jk 1.2.6</b> to avoid problem with hung tomcat's and require ajp13 
ping/pong support which has been implemented on Tomcat <b>3.3.2+, 4.1.28+ and 5.0.13+</b>.
Disabled by default.

<directive name="reply_timeout" default="0" required="false">
Reply_timeout property told webserver to wait some time for reply to a forwarded request
before considering the remote tomcat is dead and eventually switch to another tomcat in a cluster
group. By default webserver will wait forever which could be an issue for you.
The parameter is the number of milliseconds to wait for reply, so adjust it carefully if you 
have long running servlets.

This features has been added in <b>jk 1.2.6</b> to avoid problem with hung tomcat's and works on all
servlet engines supporting ajp13.
Disabled by default.

<directive name="recovery_options" default="0" required="false">
Recovery options property told webserver how to handle recovery when
it detect that tomcat failed.
By default, webserver will forward the request to another tomcat in LB mode
(or to another ajp thread in ajp13 mode).
values are : 0 (full recovery), 1 (don't recover if tomcat failed after getting the request),
2 (don't recover if tomcat failed after sending the headers to client), 3 (don't recover if tomcat failed 
getting the request or after sending the headers to client).

<directive name="domain" default="" required="false">
Domain directive can be used only when the worker is a member of the load balancer.
Workers that share the same domain name are treated as single worker. If sticky_session
is used, then the domain name is used as session route.
<p>This directive is used for large system with more then 6 Tomcats, to be able
to cluster the Tomcats in two groups and thus lowering the session replication
transfer between them.
