How to do a Tomcat Native release
=================================

Requirements
------------

Java 11
Apache Ant 1.9 or later
Apache APR 1.7.0 or later source


Preparation
-----------

Review the open issues in Bugzilla.
Review open PRs in GitHub.

If you haven't already, add your public PGP key to KEYS.

Ensure dates and/or version numbers are up to date:

- native/build/rpm/tcnative.spec.in
- native/include/tcn_version.h
- native/os/win32/libtcnative.rc x3
- xdocs/miscellaneous/changelog.xml

Run the release script to check the Java code is aligned with the current 12.0.x
source.
./jnirelease.sh --ver=main --with-apr=/path/to/apr/source

Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

git pull
git status

# Edit files to remove / disable dev build flags
