How to do a Tomcat Native release
=================================

Requirements
------------

Java 8
Apache Ant 1.9 or later
Apache APR 1.4.3 or later source (1.7.0 or later recommended)


Preparation
-----------

Review the open issues in Bugzilla.
Review open PRs in GitHub.

If you haven't already, add your public PGP key to KEYS.

Ensure dates and/or version numbers are up to date:
- build.properties.default
- native/build/rpm/tcnative.spec.in
- native/include/tcn_version.h
- native/os/win32/libtcnative.rc
- xdocs/miscellaneous/changelog.xml

Run the release script to check the Java code is aligned with the current 9.0.x
source.
./jnirelease.sh --ver=1.2.x --with-apr=/path/to/apr/source

Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

Tagging
-------

# Check clone is up to date and clean
git pull
git status

# Edit files to remove / disable dev build flags
# - build.properties.default
# - tcn_version.h

# Confirm the previous edits
git diff

# Tag (modify version as appropriate)
git commit -a -m "Tag 1.2.35"
git tag 1.2.35
git push origin 1.2.35
