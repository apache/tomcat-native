The current minimum versions are:
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 
- APR 1.6.3

The following version of the libraries are recommended:

- APR 1.7.4 or later, http://apr.apache.org
- OpenSSL 3.0.14 or later, http://www.openssl.org

Older versions should also work but are not as thoroughly tested by the Tomcat
Native team
